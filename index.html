My Cause

<p>
My cause, or my drive to action is my belief of Marvel's superiority over DC comics.
  From movies, characters, and even story telling, Marvel's organization of all three exceed expectations and blow any other company out of the water.
  For instance, the fact that Marvel Studios have numerious top 50 grossing movies of all time, just goes to show how inferior DC is when attempting to make a movie.
  Another example would be critic ratings of these movies displayed by both companies, showing how the public view the two compaines ideas of displaying and portraying charaters into the media.
